# Todo With Vue

Heard great things about vuejs, so decided to try it out.

Read through the docs, (which are great!) but realized I needed to try it out, so made todo app.

I found vue super easy to pick up (for basics that I tried out!).  Plus the convenience of just writing everything in vanilla javascript.  I'd like to try vue out again with a more dynamic page.
